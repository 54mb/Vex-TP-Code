# Code for USC VEXU Robotics Team

## Information:
The VEX Robotics World Championship is the largest robotics competition in the world.
Each year, a game is announced to test team's ability to design, build, and program robotic systems.

## Outcome:
In 2019, the USC VEXU Robotics Team was awarded the Excellence Award, given to the overall best team at the event.
We also placed 2nd in the Programming Skills challenge, a one minute time trial to score as high as possible using a fully autonomous system.

## Demo:
The code cannot be run without our custom hardware.
Please see these videos demonstrating the code running on the robots:
