# Code for USC VEXU Robotics Team

## Information:
The VEX Robotics World Championship is the largest robotics competition in the world.
Each year, a game is announced to test team's ability to design, build, and program robotic systems.
- VEXU Info: https://www.roboticseducation.org/vex-u/
- Code written using the PROS API: https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/index.html

## Outcome:
In 2019, the USC VEXU Robotics Team was awarded the Excellence Award, given to the overall best team at the event.
We also placed 2nd in the Programming Skills challenge, a one minute time trial to score as high as possible using a fully autonomous system.
In 2020, the world championship was canceled due to COVID-19 so we were not able to compete, but won our California regional tournament.

## Demo:
The code cannot be run without our custom hardware.
