Code for USC VEXU Robotics Team

Most relevent code is in BallBot/src/opcontrol.cpp
Autonomous routes are in BallBot/src/BallBotAutons.h - these are written in our own scripting language which opcontrol.cpp translates into commands for the robot

Appologies since the code is not particularly well organised. The competition deadlines were tight to the point at which it was more important to get the code working than to make it pretty (which I will do next).
